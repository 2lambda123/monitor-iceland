===============================

Every idea for new stuff to monitor is fair game. It should meet one or more of the following criteria:

* It should be interesting
* It should be useful
* It should benefit icelandic society
* It should be fun


Stuff/Ideas we might want in the future:
* A dashboard for email delivery in iceland
* A map with GPS coordinates of all the stuff we are monitoring (earthquake metercs, airplanes, buses, etc)
* Monitor international services often used by icelanders
* A blog-style page with stuff that is interesting for us (availability reports for example)
